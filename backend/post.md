Here’s a sharper, more viral version with a stronger hook and tighter rhythm:

**Google Maps isn’t expensive. Bad implementation is.**

Most Indian founders assume Maps will burn their runway.

I did too.

Then I actually read the pricing (post-March 2025).

Here’s what India-based billing accounts get:

🇮🇳
• 70,000 free Geocoding requests / month
• 70,000 free Places Details (Essentials)
• 70,000 free Dynamic Map loads (Web)
• Unlimited Maps Embed API
• Unlimited native mobile SDK map loads

That’s not “starter friendly.”

That’s _builder friendly._

The difference?

Smart usage.

• Cache coordinates for 30 days
• Store Place IDs permanently
• Request only the fields you need
• Use session tokens for autocomplete
• Avoid unnecessary “Pro” tier calls

Most devs complain about API pricing.

Few optimize for it.

Pricing pages are part of engineering.

If you’re building from India, Google Maps isn’t the bottleneck.

Your architecture is.
